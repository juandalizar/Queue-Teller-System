# Queue-Teller-System
Our user from banking company given us the job to develop a program to manage the customers queue in a Bank. The management want you to create a system that ables to divides the right amount of queue length for each bank teller, so that there is no one teller that get a longer queue than other tellers.  However, not like the usual Bank Teller Queue Management System you found at your local bank where the system only calls the queue number, the management want the program to also be able to calls the customer's name.  Assume that there are 5 tellers available at the Bank: Angel, Mellysa, David, Thom, and Monica.  our user also wanted to know names of the first and the last customer from the program which we develop
